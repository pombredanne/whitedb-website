Most examples
you will encounter here will also be available in the Examples directory
of the WhiteDB source distribution.</p><p>A thorough reference of the API is available in the <a class="ulink" href="Manual.html" target="_top">Manual</a>. If
you’re looking for information on how to use WhiteDB from Python, please see
<a class="ulink" href="python.html" target="_top">Python documentation</a> (also in semi-tutorial form).</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_compiling_the_examples"></a>2. Compiling the examples</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we can get started with the tutorial, we need to know how to compile
and run programs that use WhiteDB.</p><p>If you invoked the standard <code class="literal">./configure; make; make install</code>, things are
quite simple. Let’s try to compile <span class="emphasis"><em>Examples/demo.c</em></span> (it’s already compiled,
but let’s do it again).</p><pre class="literallayout">gcc -o Examples/mydemo Examples/demo.c -lwgdb</pre><p>That’s it! This is how you’d normally compile and link a WhiteDB program.
The <code class="literal">-lwgdb</code> tells the linker to use <span class="emphasis"><em>libwgdb.a</em></span> that sits somewhere in your
library path. If you get an error at this point, it may be that your
computer has libraptor installed. In that case WhiteDB automatically decides
that it wants to use it; just add <code class="literal">-lraptor</code> to the command line and all
should be fine.</p><p>You can now run <code class="literal">Examples/mydemo</code> and see what it does. Also, you may skip the
rest of this section and go directly to <a class="xref" href="#anchor-1" title="3. Connecting to the database">Section 3, “Connecting to the database”</a>.</p><p>In the event that you haven’t run <code class="literal">make install</code> (let’s say you’re still
evaluating and getting acquainted with WhiteDB) or you’ve installed it
in a location that’s not in your standard library path, you’ll need to
add a few things.</p><pre class="literallayout">gcc -L/alternate/libpath -o Examples/mydemo Examples/demo.c -lwgdb</pre><p>Alternate libpath is where <span class="emphasis"><em>libwgdb.a</em></span> is on your machine. If you didn’t
<code class="literal">make install</code> at all, it is still in <span class="emphasis"><em>Main/.libs</em></span>. Also, your system probably
does not know where to look for the libraries, so if you just run
<code class="literal">Examples/mydemo</code>, it will exit with "error while loading shared libraries".</p><pre class="literallayout">LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/alternate/libpath Examples/mydemo</pre><p>will take care of that. However, things will definitely be easier once you’ve
done <code class="literal">make install</code>. Another issue that you might run into is that the compiler
does not know where the API header files are. The programs in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Examples</em></span>
directory work around that by referring to the headers in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Db</em></span> directory
directly, but you might prefer a more flexible way. In this case, try</p><pre class="literallayout">gcc -L/alternate/libpath -I/path/to/headers -o myprog myprog.c -lwgdb</pre><p>where <span class="emphasis"><em>/path/to/headers</em></span> is where <span class="emphasis"><em>dbapi.h</em></span> is located.</p><p>Finally, in the event that your system does not have the make
program or some other part of the toolchain required for the standard
installation, but you still have the C compiler, such as gcc, you may
directly compile the examples or your own programs with the WhiteDB sources.
Have a look at <span class="emphasis"><em>Examples/compile_demo.sh</em></span> to see what source files should
be compiled.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_so_you_8217_re_on_windows"></a>2.1. So you’re on Windows</h3></div></div></div><p>So far the there hasn’t been a peep about following the tutorial on a Windows
computer, but don’t feel left out - the compilation is different enough that
it deserves it’s own section.</p><p>You need the MSVC compiler (provided by Microsoft Visual Studio, Express
Edition, for example). Set it up so you can run <code class="literal">cl.exe</code> from the command
prompt. Visual Studio includes it’s own command prompt menu entry that has
the environment set up correctly for you.</p><p>First, we recommend that you compile the <span class="emphasis"><em>wgdb.lib</em></span>. If you followed the
installation documentation, you probably have it in WhiteDB’s directory
already. If not, run <code class="literal">compile.bat</code>. This produces everything you’ll
need for the tutorial. Now try:</p><pre class="literallayout">cl.exe /FeMYDEMO Examples\demo.c wgdb.lib</pre><p>This produces <span class="emphasis"><em>mydemo.exe</em></span> in the current directory. As long as the file
<span class="emphasis"><em>wgdb.dll</em></span> is also in the same directory, you can run <code class="literal">mydemo.exe</code> and see
the output.</p><p>The above command works for the distributed examples, but it should be
pointed out that the following way is more flexible, once you’ve started
creating your own programs:</p><pre class="literallayout">cl.exe /I"\path\to\whitedb\headers" yourprog.c \path\to\wgdb.lib</pre><p>Replace the <span class="emphasis"><em>\path\to..</em></span>-s with the actual directories where the WhiteDB files
are on your computer.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="anchor-1"></a>3. Connecting to the database</h2></div></div></div><p>Before you can read from or write to the WhiteDB database, your program
needs to connect to it. Let’s look at how we might do that (<span class="emphasis"><em>Examples/tut1.c</em></span>):</p><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;whitedb/dbapi.h&gt; /* or #include &lt;dbapi.h&gt; on Windows */

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  void *db;
  db = wg_attach_database("1000", 2000000);
  return 0;
}</pre><p>First, the program needs to include the API headers. There are a few other
header files distributed with WhiteDB, but <span class="emphasis"><em>dbapi.h</em></span> is the one we’ll need
for now.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0; margin-right: 10%;"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="images/icons/note.png" /></td><th align="left">Note</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>The programs in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Examples</em></span> directory use a different way of including
the headers, by referring to their location directly. This is so that the
examples can be compiled before the installation of the database and it is
perfectly acceptable - but let’s stick to the standard way of using library
headers in this tutorial.</p></td></tr></table></div><p><code class="literal">void *db</code> is the database handle. Once we have the handle, we can use it in
all the subsequent database operations - it will always point to the same
database we originally attached to. Why stress that it is the same database?
WhiteDB allows using multiple databases in parallel, without any prior
configuration. The number "1000" we give to the <code class="literal">wg_attach_database()</code> function
is the key that refers to the shared memory segment containing our database.</p><p>Observe that when using <code class="literal">wg_attach_database()</code>, it does not matter whether the
database already exists or not - it will be created, if necessary. The size
of the database will be the one we supplied, 2MB in this case. When the
program exits, the database will remain in memory.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_adding_data_to_the_database"></a>4. Adding data to the database</h2></div></div></div><p>An empty database isn’t usually much of a practical use, so we need to learn
how to populate it with data. It is actually a three-step process: creating
a record, encoding the data and writing to the fields of the records.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_records"></a>4.1. Records</h3></div></div></div><p>A WhiteDB record is a n-tuple of encoded data. The n refers to the length of
the record and there is no specific limit except that it must fit inside
the database memory segment (of course, the size is given as <code class="literal">wg_int</code>, the
universal datatype of WhiteDB, which itself has a maximum value, but this is
quite large, especially on a 64-bit system).</p><pre class="literallayout">void *rec = wg_create_record(db, 10);</pre><p>The datatype of the record is <code class="literal">void *</code>, just like the database handle. Now we
can use <code class="literal">rec</code> any time we need to do something with the record we’ve created.
By the way, the records do not all need to be the same size, so we could do</p><pre class="literallayout">void *rec2 = wg_create_record(db, 2);</pre><p>and have two records, one of them 10 fields and the other 2 fields in size.
However, the size is final and cannot be changed later.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_data_in_whitedb"></a>4.2. Data in WhiteDB</h3></div></div></div><p>An important distinction between WhiteDB and traditional databases is that
the user can and in some cases must pop the hood open and get their hands
dirty. Data encoding is one of such cases.</p><p>Everything inside the database is a "WhiteDB int", or a <code class="literal">wg_int</code> when we’re
writing C code. These are basically numbers (32-bit or 64-bit integers,
depending on your system), but for WhiteDB they contain encoded pieces of
information - type of a value and the value itself or some way to access the
value.</p><p>So whenever we need to write something, be it a string, a number or a date
to the database, first we have to encode it so that WhiteDB is ready to handle
it.</p><pre class="literallayout">wg_int enc = wg_encode_int(db, 443);
wg_int enc2 = wg_encode_str(db, "this is my string", NULL);</pre><p>The first line should be self-explanatory - <code class="literal">enc</code> is now 443 in WhiteDB’s
internal format. When encoding a string, be aware that the string itself
will be written to the database memory segment at that point - the encoded
value <code class="literal">enc2</code> will merely contain a reference to it. Also, there is a third
parameter which we can ignore for simple applications.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_setting_field_values"></a>4.3. Setting field values</h3></div></div></div><p>You may be asking yourself why do we need to bother with encoding the values
when we could simply write things like integers or character arrays directly.
The main reason for that is that WhiteDB is schemaless. When we created
records, we did not specify what type any of the fields were - they can be of
any type.  The encoded value is how WhiteDB can tell what type of data it is
dealing with, since field 1 could be an integer in one record, a
floating-point number in another one and so on.</p><p>With that out of the way, let’s take our encoded data and store it properly
in the database:</p><pre class="literallayout">wg_set_field(db, rec, 7, enc);
wg_set_field(db, rec2, 0, enc2);</pre><p>Field 7 of the first record now contains 443 and field 0 of the second record
(which has two fields, field 0 and field 1) contains "this is my string".</p><p>We didn’t touch any of the other fields and if we were to look at the
contents of the records now, these would be filled with NULL values. Each time
a new record is created, it initially contains a row of NULL-s which the user
can then overwrite with their own data.</p><p>Here is our complete example (<span class="emphasis"><em>Examples/tut2.c</em></span>):</p><pre class="programlisting">#include &lt;whitedb/dbapi.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  void *db, *rec, *rec2;
  wg_int enc, enc2;

  db = wg_attach_database("1000", 2000000);
  rec = wg_create_record(db, 10);
  rec2 = wg_create_record(db, 2);

  enc = wg_encode_int(db, 443);
  enc2 = wg_encode_str(db, "this is my string", NULL);

  wg_set_field(db, rec, 7, enc);
  wg_set_field(db, rec2, 0, enc2);

  return 0;
}</pre><p>It is likely that you need to deal with more types than just strings and
integers. <a class="ulink" href="Manual.html" target="_top">The manual</a> will provide a full list of supported types.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_the_wgdb_utility"></a>5. The wgdb utility</h2></div></div></div><p>Once you’ve started working with WhiteDB, the <code class="literal">wgdb</code> tool may come in handy
to manage the databases, so let’s take a quick look at it. First we deal with
database persistence, you may skip to <a class="xref" href="#anchor-2" title="5.2. Looking at data">Section 5.2, “Looking at data”</a> if you’re not on
Windows.</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_database_persistence_on_windows"></a>5.1. Database persistence on Windows</h3></div></div></div><p>The way shared memory works on Windows is that it is only present as long as
there is a program holding a handle to it. So when we compile and run the
previous example, the data gets written to the memory but then the program
terminates and the database immediately disappears. To get around that, run</p><pre class="literallayout">wgdb.exe 1000 server 2000000</pre><p>in another window. That will keep the shared memory present, until you press
CTRL+C. You can now run the tutorial programs and the following examples
should work.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="anchor-2"></a>5.2. Looking at data</h3></div></div></div><p>If you ran the program from the previous section, there should be some records
in memory now. Let’s take a look:</p><pre class="literallayout">wgdb 1000 select 20</pre><p>It should return something like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">[NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,443,NULL,NULL]
["this is my string",NULL]</pre><p>The "1000" in the command is the same shared memory key we used earlier.
"select" prints records from the database and "20" limits the maximum number
of records that will be shown. There is also a query command that lets you
specify which records you are interested in:</p><pre class="literallayout">wgdb 1000 query 7 = 443</pre><p>That will only return the first record, the one where field 7 equals 443.
There are other comparison operators: "!=" for not equal, "&lt;" for less than,
"&lt;=" for less than or equal and so forth. Currently the query command does not
have a row limit parameter.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_modifying_data"></a>5.3. Modifying data</h3></div></div></div><p>The command line tools allows some data manipulation: deleting and adding
records. The "del" command has the same syntax as the query command, so</p><pre class="literallayout">wgdb 1000 del 7 = 443</pre><p>will delete the first row from the database. We can also add records, but
only integer and string values are recognized this way - dealing with other
types unambiguously would become complicated.</p><pre class="literallayout">wgdb 1000 add 1 2 3</pre><p>This created a record with the length 3 and inserted three integer values
in it. Let’s see what the database now contains. By the way, since "1000" is
the default key, we may omit it:</p><pre class="literallayout">wgdb select 20</pre><p>The entire contents of the database will now be:</p><pre class="literallayout">["this is my string",NULL]
[1,2,3]</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_freeing_the_memory"></a>5.4. Freeing the memory</h3></div></div></div><p>At some point we may need to delete the database for whatever reason. The
<code class="literal">wgdb</code> tool will help:</p><pre class="literallayout">wgdb 1000 free</pre><p>The database with the given key will be freed. Again, "1000" may be omitted
as it is the default.</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_making_queries"></a>6. Making queries</h2></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_detaching_and_deleting_a_database"></a>7. Detaching and deleting a database</h2></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_parallel_use"></a>8. Parallel use</h2></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="_more_examples"></a>9. More examples</h2></div></div></div><p>There are a few more examples distributed with WhiteDB that were not covered
